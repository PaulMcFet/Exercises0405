Create a new express project for a simple calculator API
Create a CommonJS calculator module with functions for:

adding numbers
subtracting numbers
multiplying numbers
dividing numbers
checking if a number is even
checking if a number is odd
getting the factorial of a number (optional)
checking if a number is prime (optional)

Create GET routes for all of your calculator functionality in the index.js file using Express. You should use query parameters and path variables as you see appropriate for this task to pass the data in.
The responses from your API should take the following form in JSON:


// Example response 1
{
    "operation": "division",
  "number1": 10,
  "number2": 4
  "result": 2.5
}
// Example response 2
{
    "operation": "factorial",
  "number": 10,
  "result": 3628800
}
